A video demonstrating the project can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4wrTtsGL1M



Your first option for accessing the project is through the github-hosted site at https://ijedi1234.github.io/CS424_Project3/



Begin a python server in the project directory that has index.html.

If you use Python 2.7 or below, begin the python server through the command "python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]".

If you use Python 3 or above, begin the python server through the command "python3 -m http.server [port]".

Use a usable port number for [port]. 8080 is a good number for this.

Then, go to localhost:[port]. If you used 8080 for the port number, use localhost:8080.

The paper paperShort.pdf in this github repo has more, but brief information on the project.
